## Predicting Potential Churn Customers
Customers in the telecom sector have access to a variety of service providers and can actively switch from one operator to another.

Customer retention has now surpassed customer acquisition in importance due to the fact that it is 5â€“10 times more expensive to gain new customers than to keep existing ones. Retaining highly profitable consumers is the top business objective for many established operators. Telecom businesses must identify the consumers who are most likely to leave in order to reduce customer turnover. After running different models, I finalized XGBoost model with Top 15 features which had the lowest False Positive rate at 11% and with Recall as 80.4%.
